			PREDICTING MARKET VOLATILITY
			<br>
			WITH TRUMP TWEETS
		</h2>
		FALL 2019
		<p id = 'project0'>
			We live in a digital world that is ever-changing, from the sources of our information, to the credibility we place in various online mediums, and the ease and patterns of disseminating information. Online text is incredibly powerful. Furthermore, social media is ubiquitous, and Twitter alone produces, on average, 500 million tweets a day. Individual tweets can have profound a effect.

			Another global trend is that the political landscape is becoming increasingly polarizing. Within the United States, we are experiencing a unique period in history. To this end, tweets, especially political ones, are influential and ripe for analysis. Throughout the past four years, President Donald Trump has often tweeted about both market related and nonrelated topics. Through this project, we sought to discover a relationship between intraday CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) / S&P 500 data and President Trump's tweets from January 2016 to November 2019.

			AUTOMATING INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION
			<br>
			FOR THE ECONOMIC CENSUS
		</h2>
		SUMMER 2019
		<p id = 'project1'>
			Each business establishment in the United States is assigned a six-digit industry classification code, per the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/economic-census/guidance/understanding-naics.html" style = "color: #5174BF"> North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)</a>, that describes its primary business activity. Industry classification codes are crucial for the United States Census Bureau to describe domestic economic activity and its dynamics. The Census Bureau spends considerable time and resources identifying and classifying the industry of establishments. The burden of collection is significant on business establishments as they are required to fill out lengthy and tedious surveys, as well as on the Census Bureau due to high mail-out and analyst costs. To ameliorate these issues, I implemented a segment of a machine learning pipeline that uses public data associated with American business establishments from the Google Places API to generate their associated six-digit industry classification codes. This technology has projected savings of $1.2 million for the Census Bureau.

			PACK & MATCH
		</h2>
		WINTER 2018
		<p id = 'project3'>
		Pack&Match is a food management web application that connects Harvard University Dining Services (HUDS) to local food shelters. In 2017, HUDS had over 30,700 meals worth of food leftover. While HUDS does currently donate these excess meals, their current methods do not allow for the shelters to request specific types of food that they need and for HUDS to indicate the specific types of food that they have leftover on a daily basis.

		The Pack&Match web application allows for shelters to make requests for specific food categories, as late as the day before they require the supplies. An optimization algorithm then ranks the shelters, taking into account the shelter’s specific requests and their distance away from HUDS. The top three shelters will then be “matched” to HUDS by this web application, who proceeds to donate that day’s excess meals accordingly.
